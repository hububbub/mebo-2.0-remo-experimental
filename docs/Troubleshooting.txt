Mebo Control - Troubleshooting

1. Wi-Fi Connection Issues
- Ensure you are connected to the Mebo robot’s Wi-Fi network.
- If no Wi-Fi appears, reset the Mebo by turning it off/on.
- Try the "Reconnect Now" button in the dashboard.

2. Video/Audio Issues
- Check that your computer microphone and speakers are enabled.
- Restart the app if video feed freezes.
- On Raspberry Pi, ensure camera/audio modules are enabled.

3. AI Model Errors
- If models fail to load: check that required model files exist in /models.
- Use the Setup Wizard -> Import Models option to reimport models.
- Try switching to a smaller model (like Mistral 7B instead of larger ones).

4. Installer/Setup Problems
- Windows: right-click installer -> Run as Administrator.
- macOS: right-click .dmg -> Open to bypass Gatekeeper for unsigned builds.
- Linux: chmod +x .AppImage before running.

5. Reset/Repair
- Delete config.json in the app’s folder to restart Setup Wizard.
- If all else fails, reinstall the app using the provided installer.
